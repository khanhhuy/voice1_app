# Sample conversation texts for testing

So, I didn't think she'd actually say it, you know? Like, ever. But then, out of nowhere, she just looks at me, I'm not even kidding, and goes, I'm so proud of you. And I didn't even know, like, what to say. I swear, it was like I just forgot how to breathe. All the noise in my head just stopped. Yeah. Honestly, that moment, it was the best. I think, ah, yeah, I'm probably never gonna forget that.

You got it. So... think about it. You like coffee, books, being outside. Those are are like built in conversation starters. Next time you're at a bookstore, strike up a chat with someone browsing the same shelf. Or compliment someone's dog at the park....People love to talk about things there and too. It's human nature

Okay, so I took the first bite and oh my god, it was like being 10 years old again. Like picture this grandma's kitchen on a Sunday morning. Can you imagine like seriously that flaky crust the smell of cinnamon? Oh my god. Mmm Yeah, just perfect. I almost cried. I'm not even kidding like seriously

TTS systems don't really, you know, really get the correct way to intone like actual disfluencies when people are kind of like talking.

Yeah, exactly! So like... you've already got everything you need, right? I mean, you're into coffee, books, the outdoors - those are perfect conversation starters right there. Next time you're grabbing coffee and someone's reading something interesting, just say "Hey, how's that book?" Or if you're hiking and pass someone on the trail, ask about their favorite spots. People absolutely love talking about stuff they care about - it's just natural, you know?

I mean, I never expected her to actually go there, right? But then she just turns to me - completely out of the blue - and she's like, "You know what? I'm really proud of you." And I'm just standing there like... what do you even say to that? It was like everything just went quiet, you know? All that stuff that's always going on in my head just... stopped. Man, I don't think anything's ever hit me like that before. That's gonna stick with me forever, I think.
