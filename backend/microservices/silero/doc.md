Context is: I have a Node server that receives audio wav streamed from the browser. The audio is created by a user who is speaking. I want to detect when the user starts/stops speaking so I can guess if they have ended their turn.

The idea is to user vad silero model to detect when speech starts and stops.

Example from silero docs:
```python
## using VADIterator class

vad_iterator = VADIterator(model, sampling_rate=SAMPLING_RATE)
wav = read_audio(f'en_example.wav', sampling_rate=SAMPLING_RATE)

window_size_samples = 512 if SAMPLING_RATE == 16000 else 256
for i in range(0, len(wav), window_size_samples):
    chunk = wav[i: i+ window_size_samples]
    if len(chunk) < window_size_samples:
      break
    speech_dict = vad_iterator(chunk, return_seconds=True)
    if speech_dict:
        print(speech_dict, end=' ')
vad_iterator.reset_states() # reset model states after each audio
```

The `utils_vad.py` is the implementation of the silero vad repo.

The `vad_server.py` is my implementation that use the `utils_vad.py` to detect speech.

My questions are:
- In `vad_server.py`, can a chunk return multiple [start, end] results?
- In `vad_server.py`, if a chunk is already processed, it won't be processed again but it's still in the model to make the prediction more accurate. Is this correct?

Imagine I have this stream of chunks, 0 means non speech, 1 means speech:
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

What is the result if I run this chunks through the `vad_server.py`?

Context: NodeJs send audio chunk to vad_server.py, the chunk has sampling rate 16000.
Each chunk contains 100ms audio data.

According to Silero doc, it can only accept 512 chunks per call, chunk size is 32 ms, and each second of the audio contains 31.25 chunks.

The microservices/utils_vad.py is copied from the silero vad repo, it contains helper classes and functions that will be used in microservices/vad_server.py

The call flow is: src/modules/conversations/audioProcessor.ts -> vad_server.py -> utils_vad.py

In `vad_server.py`, it looks like the chunk size is incorrect, it needs to be 512 chunks before calling `self.vad_iterator`
```
 self.vad_iterator(chunk_float32, return_seconds=True)
```

Analyze the chunk processing login in `vad_server.py` to see how to correctly process the chunk.





# Calculation

rate=16000

frames_per_buffer= rate / 10 = 1600

frames_to_record = 50

num_samples = 512

each frame, wait stream.read

audio_chunk = stream.read(num_samples)

chunk size is 32 ms, and each second of the audio contains 31.25 chunks
currently only chunks of size 512 are used for 16 kHz and 256 for 8 kHz
e.g. 512 / 16000 = 256 / 8000 = 0.032 s = 32.0 ms


1 second = 16000 samples
1 second = 31.25 chunks
1 second = 

1 chunk = 0.032s
1 chunk = 512 samples


Frequency: 16000 samples/s
1 sample = 1 / 16000 sec = 0.0625ms
512 samples = 32ms


How many bytes per sample?
- Bit depth: 16

16,000 samples/second × 2 bytes/sample = 32,000 bytes/second = 32 KB/s

Browser captures every 100ms, array.byteLength is 9600 bytes
So:
- 100ms = 9600 bytes
-

Your WAV file properties:

Sample rate: 48,000 Hz (48 kHz)
Bit depth: Int16 = 16-bit integer
Bytes per sample: 2 bytes (since 16 bits = 2 bytes)
Channels: 1 (mono)

Key calculations:

1 sample = 1/48,000 second = ~0.0208 ms
Data rate: 48,000 samples/sec × 2 bytes/sample = 96,000 bytes/sec = 96 KB/s

Verification:
Your file duration (9.7 seconds) × 96,000 bytes/sec = 931,200 bytes, which matches the "audio bytes" shown in the output. ✅
Note: This file is actually 48 kHz, not the 16 kHz you mentioned in your original question. Many web browsers and MediaRecorder implementations default to 48 kHz sample rate rather than 16 kHz.
