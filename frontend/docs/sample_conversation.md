Sarah: Hey Michael! Good to see you. How's everything going?
Michael: Not bad, thanks! Just trying to survive Monday morning, you know how it is.
Sarah: laughs Tell me about it. So I've got Jake and Lisa here with me today. Jake's our tech guy, and Lisa basically makes sure our customers don't hate us.
Lisa: chuckles That's one way to put it!
Jake: Hey Michael, how's it going?
Michael: Good, good. So look, I'll be straight with you guys - our inventory system is kind of a mess right now.
Sarah: Yeah, you mentioned that last time. Still doing everything manually?

Michael: Pretty much. My team's pulling their hair out spending half their week just trying to figure out what we actually have in stock. And here's the thing - it's not just the time we're wasting, it's the domino effect, you know? Last month we had three major customers place orders for stuff we thought we had, but turns out our Denver warehouse was showing phantom inventory. So we had to scramble, pay rush shipping from our Phoenix location, and one client was so frustrated they're now questioning whether to renew their contract with us. My warehouse manager in Denver is basically doing inventory counts every other day just to stay sane, and my customer service team is fielding angry calls because nobody knows what's actually available. It's like we're playing whack-a-mole, but the moles are multiplying faster than we can hit them.

Jake: Oof, that's rough. How many locations are we talking about total?

Michael: Four warehouses, and honestly, it's like they're all speaking different languages.

Lisa: Oh man, I feel for your team. We had another client with the same headache - they were ready to quit before we got them sorted out.
Sarah: Want to see how we could fix this for you? Jake can show you the cool stuff.
Michael: Yeah, let's see what you've got. Just please tell me it actually works with our ancient ERP system.
Jake: laughs Don't worry, we've seen some pretty ancient systems. Let me share my screen...
