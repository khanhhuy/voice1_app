So, like, dashboards for execs? Self-serve stuff for analysts? Who specifically did the team book you with tomorrow—any idea of their role or what they’re hoping to see?

 Ah gotcha, so they're a savvy analyst who's probably tried the big names and is shopping around - those folks can be... a bit skeptical at first.

Okay, so with someone like that, I'd lean into the "help me understand your current workflow" angle rather than pitching features, yeah?

 Because they’ve already demo’d half the market—if you dive into features they’ll mentally check off “yeah, Power BI does that too” and tune out.

But if you get them talking about the annoying parts of their day (waiting on data refreshes, explaining dashboards to clueless stakeholders, etc.) they’ll actually reveal the gaps your thing could fill.

 Hmm, yeah—sometimes the pricier tools leave scabs they don’t brag about.

How about starting with: “So what pushed you to kick the tires on something new?”—often surfaces the hidden gotcha (slow support, crazy licensing, etc.) without you guessing.

 Makes sense, yeah—scope and head-count drive pricing, but... straight-up asking “how many licenses?” can feel sales-y.

How about: “Who else besides you usually dives into these dashboards?”—keeps it conversational, and the org map usually spills out naturally.

 Cool, glad that clicks.

One more quick one—are you planning to record the call or just take notes? Analysts can get skittish if they feel you’re mining evidence for sales, so worth flagging it up front, yeah?

 Exactly—just drop it in the agenda bit: “Mind if we record so I don’t miss anything? Only used internally.”

Quickie tip: if they hesitate, offer to stop the recording any time; usually calms the “big-brother” worry.

 Nah, just the old “we’re watching you” vibe—people hear “recorded” and worry their boss will see every gripe they air. Saying it’s only for note-taking and they can pause anytime usually kills that fear.
